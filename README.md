Introduction 
What is Neural Networks?
Neural Networks are computational systems inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers that process information.

Neurons and Layers:
1. Neurons: These are the basic units that receive inputs, apply weights to them, and pass the result through an activation function.
2. Layers: Neurons are organized into layersâ€”input, hidden, and output layers. Input layer receives initial data, hidden layers process information, and output layer produces the final result.
