Introduction 
What is Neural Networks?
Neural Networks are computational systems inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers that process information.

Neurons and Layers:
1. Neurons: These are the basic units that receive inputs, apply weights to them, and pass the result through an activation function.
2. Layers: Neurons are organized into layersâ€”input, hidden, and output layers. Input layer receives initial data, hidden layers process information, and output layer produces the final result.

Some of its applications are: 
1. Image and Speech Recognition: CNNs excel in recognizing patterns and features within images and audio.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): RNNs are effective in processing sequences of words for tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation.
3. Predictive Analysis and Forecasting: Neural networks are used extensively in financial forecasting, trend analysis, and predictive modeling.

Types of Neural Netowrks: 
1. Artificial Neural Netowrks (ANN)
2. Convolution Neural Netowkr (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)


Here is a very informative video about Neural Networks. It is a video by 3Blue1Brown [What is Neural Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)
The Image Below is a representation of what a Neural Network is in simple terms
So Neural Network is inspired by the biological neuron in a simplified manner. A biological neuron is a cell that processes and transmits information in the brain. It consists of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites receive signals, the cell body processes these signals, and the axon transmits signals to other neurons.
